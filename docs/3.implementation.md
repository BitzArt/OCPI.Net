## How to implement OCPI modules using OCPI.Net

Refer to the [Sample application](sample/OCPI.Net.Sample) for a working example of how to use the package.

Apply `OcpiEndpoint` attribute to your module controllers to specify their OCPI versions. The package will perform an automated scan of your controllers and generate a list of supported OCPI versions for each module.

```csharp
[OcpiEndpoint(OcpiModule.Credentials, "Receiver", "2.2.1")]
[Route("2.2.1/credentials")]
public class OcpiCredentialsController : OcpiController
{
    // Implement your module methods here
}
```

Refer to the [Versioning](4.versioning.md) section for more information on OCPI module versioning.

## Customizing the package to meet specific business needs

The package is designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to implement OCPI modules in any way you see fit. The package contains a number of services which are used to perform various tasks such as validating incoming requests, generating responses, and handling errors.

You are not forced to use any of these services, and you can implement your own services if you wish. The package also allows you to override some of the default services with your own custom implementations.

Refer to the [Architecture](2.architecture.md) section for more information on the package's architecture.
