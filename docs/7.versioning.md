## Versioning

The OCPI.Net package supports multiple OCPI versions at the same time. The package uses the `OcpiEndpoint` attribute to determine which OCPI versions are supported by a given controller.

Refer to the [Implementation](3.implementation.md) section for more information on how to implement OCPI modules using OCPI.Net.

### How to implement OCPI Versions Module

After you have marked your OCPI controllers with the `OcpiEndpoint` attribute, the package becomes aware of the OCPI versions supported by each controller. The package will automatically generate a list of supported OCPI versions for each module.

An [example](/sample/OCPI.Net.Sample/Controllers/OcpiVersionsController.cs) of how to implement the OCPI Versions module is provided in the [Sample application](/sample/OCPI.Net.Sample).

In your Versions Module controller, inject the `IOcpiVersionsService` service and use it to retrieve the list of supported OCPI versions for each module:

```csharp
var versionService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOcpiVersionService>();
```

Use the `GetVersions` method to get a list of all supported OCPI versions:

```csharp
var versionInfo = versionService.GetVersions();
```

Use the `GetVersionDetails` method to get a list of all supported OCPI endpoints for a given version:

```csharp
var details = versionService.GetVersionDetails(request);
```

### Example Versions Module implementation

```csharp
[Route("versions")]
public class OcpiVersionsController : OcpiController
{
    // This service scans your codebase and maps all OCPI paths from
    // controllers marked with OcpiEndpoint attribute on startup.
    private readonly IOcpiVersionService _versionService;

    public OcpiVersionsController(IOcpiVersionService versionService)
    {
        _versionService = versionService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetVersionsAsync()
    {
        var versionInfo = _versionService.GetVersions();
        return OcpiOk(versionInfo);
    }

    [HttpGet("{request}")]
    public IActionResult GetVersionDetailsAsync([FromRoute] string request)
    {
        var details = _versionService.GetVersionDetails(request);
        return OcpiOk(details);
    }
}
```

### How to support multiple OCPI versions at the same time

The package allows you to support multiple OCPI versions at the same time. You can do this by marking your controllers with the `OcpiEndpoint` attribute and specifying the OCPI versions supported by each controller.

```csharp
[OcpiEndpoint(OcpiModule.Credentials, "Receiver", "2.2, 2.2.1")]
[Route("2.2/credentials")]
[Route("2.2.1/credentials")]
public class OcpiCredentialsController : OcpiController
{
    // Implement your module methods here
}
```

### How to handle version-specific differences in OCPI modules

You can implement version-specific controllers for different versions of the same OCPI Module.

```csharp
[OcpiEndpoint(OcpiModule.Credentials, "Receiver", "2.1.1")]
[Route("2.1.1/credentials")]
public class OcpiCredentialsV1Controller : OcpiController
{
    // Code specific to OCPI 2.1.1
}

[OcpiEndpoint(OcpiModule.Credentials, "Receiver", "2.2.1")]
[Route("2.2.1/credentials")]
public class OcpiCredentialsV2Controller : OcpiController
{
    // Code specific to OCPI 2.2.1
}
```
