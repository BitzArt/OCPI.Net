## OCPI Contracts

The package contains a number of classes which are used to represent OCPI objects. You can see the full list of contract models [here](https://github.com/BitzArt/OCPI.Net/tree/main/src/OCPI.Net.Contracts).


### Validation

The package contains a collection of validators which you can use to validate incoming OCPI requests. To use a validator, call the `OcpiValidate` method of the `OcpiController` class. The method only allows validating OCPI models from the `OCPI.Contracts` namespace. In case of invalid request, further request handling will be aborted, and the error response will be returned to the client.

```csharp
[OcpiEndpoint(OcpiModule.Locations, "Receiver", "2.2.1")]
[Route("2.2.1/locations")]
[OcpiAuthorize]
public class OcpiLocationsReceiverController : OcpiController
{
    [HttpPut("{countryCode}/{partyId}/{locationId}")]
    public IActionResult Put(
        [FromRoute] string countryCode,
        [FromRoute] string partyId,
        [FromRoute] string locationId,
        [FromBody] OcpiLocation location)
    {
        // Use a built-in OCPI validator
        OcpiValidate(location);

        // Your Location PUT logic

        Return OcpiOk(result);
    }

    // Other endpoint methods...
}
```

Validation functionality is built on top of [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) nuget package.
